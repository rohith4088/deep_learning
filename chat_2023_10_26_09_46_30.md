1. **You**: Explain the following code in detail: 
```python
x = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
y = [[9,8,7],[6,5,4],[3,2,1]]
res = [list(map(sum,zip(*t))) for t in zip(x,y)]
print(res)
res2 = [[a*b for a,b in zip(i,j)] for i,j in zip(x,y)]
print(res2)
transpose  = [list(row) for row in zip(*res2)]
print(transpose)
```
